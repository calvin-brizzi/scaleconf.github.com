        <h3>Topics</h3>
        <p>
          We love variety, and welcome any talk that tends toward
          technology or culture in the context of building scalable
          websites, services, systems, companies, or teams.
        </p>

          Take a look through <a href="/speakers">previous
          speakers</a> for ideas.

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
          We like speakers to have the control they need around the structure
          of their talks. The sessions are 45 minutes long, and we'll be there
          to give time reminders. We advise speakers to leave at least 5 minutes
          at the end of their talk for questions, but feel free to leave more.

        <h3>What's on stage</h3>
        <p>
          There will be a lectern on stage, which can hold a laptop, and
          has a microphone attached. There is also a roaming wireless microphone
          and a clip-on microphone available. We will have a MacBook Pro
          available with Keynote and Microsoft PowerPoint installed. We will
          have connectors available for Mac and PC into the AV system.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hall is relatively narrow and deep, and so we advise a slightly
          larger font than usual. Screencasts and live demos can also be
          difficult for people past the first few rows to see properly. The venue
          will have good wifi, but we can't guarantee connectivity. For this 
          reason we advise against live demos that require a network.
        </p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
          There will be roughly 400 people at the conference. Since it's single
          track, almost all of them will be at your talk. The majority of the
          audience are engineers; developers, operations, devops, sysadmins.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a good range of experience from students to the old hats.
